# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Grace and I like to organize stuff.

I'm an Information Architect / UX Strategist with a background in Library and Information Studies. I have 13+ years' experience in **design research**, **information architecture**, and **interaction design**. I help people do what they need to do, find what they need to find.

- Design Research
- Information Architecture
